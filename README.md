**ECTS**: 5

**Type**: BEng

**Scope**: Analysis and design with a high degree of self motivation. The work is performed in groups

# Objectives
**General**: The primary objective of the course is twofold. First, it seeks to equip the students with a fundamental comprehension of electrical energy systems. This includes everything from the production, distribution, and control of electrical energy to the building of rectifier circuits, complete with their associated voltage supplies, both with and without galvanic separation. Second, the course aims to develop the student's skills in project and group work, emphasizing all aspects of the CDIO (Conceive, Design, Implement, Operate) process, from the initial idea generation through to the completion of a functional model.

**Learning**: A student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:
- Perform basic calculations in power converting systems.
- Calculate power for stationary ac circuits and determine load impedance for maximum power transfer.
- Explain the operation of coils, capacitors, diodes and mosfets in power-electronics-circuits.
- Working with equivalents for electrical machines.
- Determine the timedomain behaviour of voltages and currents and derive the transfer function for basic converter topologies.
- To implement parts of a minor energy system from sources to loads via an energy storage
- Divide a larger task into smaller sub-tasks and organize the solution of the work tasks between the participant
- Document achieved results in a precise and concise way.
- Plan and document a larger project from idea to implementation

# Content
The course is rooted in the CDIO principles, so that the students get through all the CDIO phases in the project period from idea generation to a functioning functional model which is based on an electrical energy system.

Basic concepts related to power converting systems are touched upon, as well as complex power and voltage ratios. In addition to this, electrical machines and the transition to smartgrids are processed. Subsequently, the focus is on basic converter topologies, including diodes, mosfets, capacitors, and coils.

Electronics-based systems are most often a primary technology driver in the sustainability development, where these contribute to the logistics management of sustainable resources in a social, an economic and an environmental dimension. This sustainability angle is included implicitly in the learning objectives of the course.
